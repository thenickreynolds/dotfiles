# WIP (Work In Progress)

Quick commit to save current work state.

## Instructions

1. Stage all changes: `git add --all`
2. Create a commit with message "WIP" or "WIP: <brief context from changed files>"
3. Do NOT push - this is just for local state saving
4. Report what was committed

## Notes

- This is for quick saves, not proper commits
- User can use `/fix` later to amend with a proper message
- Or `git reset HEAD~1` to undo and recommit properly
